    <h1>About Money</h1>
    <p>Money is a necessary part of everyday life but can also be a bad master if it controls a person. It allows people to meet basic needs like food and shelter by working and earning income. However, too much focus on money can damage relationships and health as people become slaves to accumulating wealth. While money solves problems and brings happiness through consumption, true happiness comes from health, relationships, and experiences, not money alone. Overall, money should be a good servant that a person controls rather than their master.</p>
